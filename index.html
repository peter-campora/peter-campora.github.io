  <h2>Background</h2>  
  <p>I'm a sixth year PhD student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette who is studying programming language
    theory with Dr. Sheng Chen as my advisor. My primary research focus has been  using variational
    typing as a means to analyze the properties of gradually typed programs--for use in the creation of tools aiding program migration.
    In general, I am interested in making Gradual Typing easier to implement and use and two of my current research directions are
    using variational typing to discover bugs in gradual programs and to use variational typing to improve the performance of gradual programs
    with a form of code specialization.
  </p>
  <p> The future research directions that I am most interested
    in are live programming and reasoning about partial programs or statically typed programs with missing type information. I suspect that my
    previous work combining variational and gradual typing will allow me to make inroads in these directions. I am also interesting in cost analysis
    for gradually typed programs and using gradual typing to link statically typed systems languages to dynamically typed scripting languages. Finally,
    I am interested in programming education and seeing how methods like blame tracking actually help students and novice programmers debug the errors in their
    gradually typed programs.

  <h2> Personal </h2>
  <p>
    Black lives matter, and it is our obligation to help fight systemic racism. LGTBTQIA+ lives matter and we must strive
    to create inclusive classroom environments where their perspectives are heard and respected. As computer science instructors and researchers
    it is our obligation to ensure that a diverse collection of voices are heard. I believe that academia needs to take mental
    health seriously for both professors/instructors and students so that severe burnout is avoided. Covid-19 has put many
    people in situations that strain their mental health; we should look to each other with empathy.
